## 🧠 PPO Reinforcement Learning Project

This repository implements and tests a **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** algorithm in a custom or Gym-compatible environment using Python and TensorFlow (or PyTorch). It includes:

- `ppoNewTrain.ipynb`: Notebook for training the PPO agent.
- `PPOtest.ipynb`: Notebook for testing and evaluating the trained agent.
- `models/`: Directory containing saved models during training.

## 🚀 Algorithm Overview

### What is PPO?

**Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** is an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm developed by OpenAI. It improves training stability by limiting the update size to the policy using a clipped objective function. PPO balances ease of implementation, sample efficiency, and performance.

Key components of PPO include:

- **Clipped Surrogate Objective**: Prevents large policy updates that could destabilize training.
- **Advantage Estimation**: Uses Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) for more stable and less noisy updates.
- **Entropy Bonus**: Encourages exploration by penalizing deterministic policies.

## 📒 Notebooks Description

### `ppoNewTrain.ipynb`
- Sets up the environment and the PPO agent.
- Defines the model architecture.
- Trains the agent over multiple episodes.
- Saves trained models in the `models/` directory.
- Uses TensorBoard or inline visualization for performance tracking.

### `PPOtest.ipynb`
- Loads a trained PPO model.
- Runs the agent in the environment to evaluate performance.
- Visualizes results and performance metrics.

---

## 🧠 Model Training

- PPO is trained using actor-critic architecture.
- Policy and value networks are updated using gradients from sampled trajectories.
- Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, gamma, and clipping range are tuned for optimal performance.

---

## 📦 Requirements

Install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install gym stable-baselines3 numpy matplotlib
```

Or use a pre-configured environment via Conda or virtualenv.

---

## 📊 Results

During training, PPO improves agent performance steadily with occasional plateaus due to the nature of policy gradient methods. Results can be visualized within the notebooks.

---

## 📌 Notes

- The project assumes that Gym-compatible environments are used.
- You can switch environments easily by replacing the `env_id` variable in the notebook.
- Saved models can be reused across different sessions and tested in the `PPOtest.ipynb` notebook.
